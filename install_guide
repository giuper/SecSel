Before you execute these installation steps, check you have the openssl development package in your system. Otherwise, install it (libssl-dev).

Instructions:
- Download MIRACL zip package (https://github.com/CertiVox/MIRACL)
- Unzip the package in a new directory (e.g. "miracl") without keeping directory structure (unzip -j -aa -L miracl.zip)
- From the MIRACL directory run "bash linux" command
- Install MIRACL (official guide http://docs.miracl.com/docs/miracl/miracl-users-manual/installation). The following are the steps for my Intel Core i5 Linux 64-bit configuration, you may need to change something for different configurations:
	- run "gcc config.c -o config"
	- run "./config" and follow the answers given in "miracl_config_options"
	- rename the generated file "mirdef.tst" to "mirdef.h"
	- rename "mrmuldv.g64" to "mrmuldv.c"
	- run "gcc -I. -c -O2 mr*.c"
	- run "ar rc miracl.a mr*.o"
- copy and paste "miracl.patch" in MIRACL folder
- run "patch < miracl.patch"
- copy and paste all the elements from the project directory to the miracl one
- run "make" command

Look at "READEME.md" to know how to run the programs.
